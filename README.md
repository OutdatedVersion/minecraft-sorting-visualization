# Minecraft Algorithm Visualizer

Platform for visualizing various sorting algorithms in Minecraft.  

I'm a visual learner so being able to see these arrays play out in real-time is very
exciting. I took inspiration from the popular [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg)
that did something very similar.  

For a basic rundown of how this works, within the stipulations of Minecraft.. I've
opted to proxy array access/insertion which creates a list of operations taken and then replay
those operations onto the "stage." The entrypoint is the `SortCommand`.
